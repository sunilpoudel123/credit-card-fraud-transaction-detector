# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing an end-to-end fraud detection system 
using supervised machine learning algorithms. 
The system was built and tested using real-world credit card transaction data from Kaggle, 
leveraging various machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions effectively.

Key Features
•	Dataset: Kaggle’s real-world credit card transaction dataset.
•	Preprocessing: Handled data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
•	Machine Learning Models:
•	Decision Tree
•	Random Forest
•	Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
•	Logistic Regression
•	AdaBoost
•	Performance Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Technologies Used
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Libraries:
•	pandas and numpy for data manipulation
•	scikit-learn for machine learning models
•	matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
•	imblearn for SMOTE
•	Environment: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

How to Run
1.	Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd fraud-detection


	2.	Install Dependencies:
Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	3.	Run the Notebook:
Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate performance.
4.	Evaluate Results:
Review the performance metrics and visualizations generated in the notebook to understand the effectiveness of each model.

Results
•	Successfully handled class imbalance with SMOTE.
•	Demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble methods (Random Forest and AdaBoost) and deep learning (ANN) in detecting fraud.
•	Achieved high precision and recall in identifying fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives and negatives.

Future Improvements
•	Incorporate unsupervised learning methods for anomaly detection.
•	Experiment with more advanced algorithms, such as XGBoost and LightGBM.
•	Test the system on larger and more diverse datasets for better generalization.
